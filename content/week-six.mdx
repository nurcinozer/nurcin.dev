## Still Reading

[Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making](https://www.buildc.com/the-book)
For the past few months, I have been practicing the technique of simultaneous reading, which involves reading multiple books at the same time. However, this week I haven't read any other book besides Build. Simultaneous reading, as you may ask, refers to reading different genres of books at the same time. I used to refrain from starting another book before finishing the one I had started, but sometimes there are moments when I don't feel the current book aligns with my mood. For instance, if I'm reading a personal development book and suddenly feel like reading a fiction book, I want to switch to it. This week, I continued reading Build because it's not just a personal development book for me; it's also a novel, a storybook. Tony Fadell's use of examples from his own experiences and offering advice made me feel like I was watching a movie. I'm currently on the final chapter of the book, and just as I mentioned last week, I highly recommend everyone to read this book.

## Watched

[Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7253506/)
I was hesitant to watch this documentary because I knew I would enjoy it and it would make me want to read all of Joan Didion books. Actually, I have had the book ['The Year of Magical Thinking'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7815.The_Year_of_Magical_Thinking) of her in my bookshelf for months, but I haven't had the chance to read it. After watching this documentary, I will start reading it right away. I didn't expect to cry so much while watching this documentary. The last 30 minutes were particularly sorrowful and caught me off guard. I am eagerly anticipating reading her literary works. However, I didn't quite like how few questions were asked when Joan Didion was sitting right in front of you on a couch, and you had the freedom to ask any question you wanted. Perhaps because the documentary was directed by her nephew. More thought-provoking questions could have been asked, and we could have learned more about her. Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching it and learned a lot about her life.
