## Started Reading

-   [Dune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune)

No offense but when I watched the movie Dune last year, I wasn't very impressed with it except for the visually stunning scenes, mainly because I was unfamiliar with the story and the books. I also thought the movie was excessively long. However, as I gained more detailed information about Dune from film review videos and podcasts, my curiosity to read the book increased. Right now, I just started reading the book, and surprisingly, it's not moving slowly as I thought. In fact, it's quite easy to read. After finishing the book, I'm considering rewatching the movie, and probably, my opinions about the film will change.

## Watched

-   [Barbie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/)

I've been trying to write this review for almost a week, and I'm still quite amazed. Barbie is truly an impressive movie. After watching it, I felt so validated hearing fellow women noticing the same things and sharing the same critiques as me. Barbie was a doll that conveyed the message that women could be whoever they wanted to be, not who society wanted them to be. I had high expectations for Gerwig, and she absolutely hit the mark with this film: it was incredibly funny, self-aware, and carried a crucial message for today's young women â€” and men, too. It's a great movie that I'm certain I'll gladly recommend.
