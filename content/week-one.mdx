## Read

-   [Ä°nsan Olmak](https://www.goodreads.com/tr/book/show/11079931)
    It describes how individuals who are constantly in communication with the outside world perceive the chaos within their own inner world as more disturbing than the chaos of the external world. It explains how people set constant traps for themselves and get caught in various vicious cycles, ultimately evading responsibility in a way. It is a book that I think everyone should read.

## Watched

-   [The Good Bad Mother](https://www.netflix.com/title/81669775)
    It's a Korean drama. It's about a mother who is trying to protect her son from the world. It's a very emotional drama and it's not finished yet. I'm waiting for the next episodes.

## Learned

-   I learned the navigation/mutation refetches with new data in React Server Components. You can look at this for more information: [RSC From Scratch](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/5)
