## Read

[Ä°nsan Olmak](https://www.goodreads.com/tr/book/show/11079931)
It's about how people who always talk to others feel more bothered by their own inner confusion than the outside chaos. It explains how people accidentally create problems for themselves and get stuck in bad loops, kind of avoiding taking responsibility. I really think everyone should read this book.

## Watched

[The Good Bad Mother](https://www.netflix.com/title/81669775)
It's a Korean drama. It's about a mother who is trying to protect her son from the world. It's a very emotional drama and it's not finished yet. I'm waiting for the next episodes.

## Learned

I learned the navigation/mutation refetches with new data in React Server Components. You can look at this for more information: [RSC From Scratch](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/5)
