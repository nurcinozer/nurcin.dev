## Start Reading

-   [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629.Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)
    My team leader at the company recommended that I read 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values.' I started reading it, and it's not a technical book or a mechanic's handbook. It's a book where the author reflects on philosophical matters while occasionally drawing from problems one might encounter while riding a motorcycle. Even though I'm only on the first few pages, some sentences feel like they've been taken from our own lives, words we've wanted to express but couldn't. I'm eager to finish it.

## Watched

-   [Working: What We Do All Day](https://www.netflix.com/title/811305765)
    It is a four-part docuseries featuring conversations between former President Barack Obama, the series' filmmakers, and workers from three distinct sectors: hospitality, home care, and tech. They discuss the daily realities of their jobs and the obstacles they encounter. Personally, I found the series to be uninteresting due to its lack of engaging storytelling, failure to delve deeper into the workers' personal experiences and insights, and a general lack of captivating moments that could have made the series more compelling and thought-provoking.

## Listened

-   [Maintainable](https://maintainable.fm/episodes/cory-house-finding-opportunities-for-improvement)
    Cory House, who is a software architect, consultant, and trainer, was the featured guest in this episode. He discusses the process of recognizing areas of improvement in your codebase and effectively conveying those opportunities to your team and management. I found this episode to be incredibly informative and beneficial. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the subject. Additionally, I follow [Cory House on Twitter](https://twitter.com/housecor), where he shares valuable insights and information about React, which I find really valuable.
