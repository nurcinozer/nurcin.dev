## Started Reading

-   [Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making](https://www.buildc.com/the-book)
    Even though I've only finished the first chapter. I must say, it's already filled with a lot of helpful advice and insights that I'm eager to delve into! In the book, Fadell talks about his own experiences in Silicon Valley, including both failures and successes. The advice he gives on leadership, design, startups, mentorship, and decision making feels relatable and down-to-earth, even though it's based on his impressive accomplishments. Even though I'm still at the beginning of the book, 'Build' has already become like a mentor for me, offering guidance and encouragement that I believe will have a big impact on my own journey. Please note that these thoughts are based solely on the first chapter, and I'm excited to uncover more of Tony Fadell's valuable insights as I continue reading it.

## Watched

-   [National Theatre Live: Fleabag](https://letterboxd.com/film/national-theatre-live-fleabag/e)
    This week, I had the opportunity to watch an outdoor cinema for the first time in years, but it wasn't a movie I saw. It was actually a recording of the Fleabag theater play, directed by Vicky Jones and featuring Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the sole performer. To put it in terms of the plot, Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) may appear overly sexualized, emotionally unfiltered, and self-absorbed, but that's just scratching the surface. With strained family and friendships, and a struggling guinea pig café, Fleabag finds herself with nothing to lose. Although the live show didn't captivate me as much as the TV series did, it was still enjoyable. What truly made Fleabag work for me was Phoebe Waller-Bridge's skillful fourth-wall breaking and the incredibly talented cast.
