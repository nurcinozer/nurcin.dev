## Still Reading

-   [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629.Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)
    Last week, I mentioned that I started reading this book, and I'm still reading it. So far, I'm really enjoying it, although I have to admit it's a bit tough to read because it has different layers.

    One layer of the book is about traveling with a motorcycle, which is pretty easy to understand since it's just about the journey itself. It tells a good story and keeps me engaged.

    The second layer is where the author shares his thoughts about motorcycles. This part can be a little challenging if you don't know much about motorcycles, but it's still interesting to get a glimpse into the author's perspective.

    The third layer is like an autobiography, where the author talks about science, philosophy, and other topics. This adds depth to the book but can be a bit complex at times.

    Overall, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a book that has different aspects to it. While it may be difficult in parts, it's also rewarding as it explores travel, motorcycles, and deep thinking.

## Watched

-   [Black Mirror Season 6](https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888)
    As a big fan of Black Mirror, I eagerly finished the latest season in just one day. While I really enjoyed the first three episodes, the fourth episode didn't meet my expectations at all. Let me briefly share my thoughts on each episode in order. The first episode, "Joan is Awful," was great, partly due to the excellent cast. The second episode felt more like a detective thriller than a typical Black Mirror episode, which surprised me, but I can't say I didn't like it. However, my favorite episode of this season by far was the third one. The plot twist at the end and Aaron Paul's sincere portrayal of emotions in the crying scenes really impressed me. As for the fourth episode, it became my least favorite Black Mirror episode since "The Waldo Moment," I suppose. While the fifth episode delivered powerful messages, I didn't quite get the same Black Mirror vibe from it. Overall, I enjoyed watching the latest season of Black Mirror, and I'm looking forward to the next one.
