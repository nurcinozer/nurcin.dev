## Read

-   [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)
    This week, I read Haruki Murakami's book 'What I Talk About When I Talk About Running.' This was my first Haruki Murakami book, and I can say that I'm very happy to have discovered him through this book. It was quite an enjoyable experience to delve into his perspective on life, what the act of writing means to him, and how he intertwines these with running, which occupies a significant part of his life. Additionally, I really liked the Turkish translation of the book's title. The original title, 'What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,' has been translated into Turkish as 'Koşmasaydım Yazamazdım,' which means 'If I Didn't Run, I Couldn't Write.' It conveys the message more directly and descriptively.

## Started Watching

-   [Silo Season 1](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/silo/umc.cmc.3yksgc857px0k0rqe5zd4jice)
    This week, I realized that I've been trying a lot of firsts, as watching 'Silo' became my first Apple series. Being a fan of dystopian films and series, this show caught my attention. It particularly reminded me of the anime 'Attack on Titan,' which is one of my favorites. As I'm writing these sentences, I'm only on the 7th episode, and next week will released the season finale with the 10th episode. Knowing that it has already been renewed for a second season, I can comfortably finish this season. If I need to talk about the series in more detail, I can say that it's one of the best shows released this year. I enjoyed it so much that I'm even starting to read the books.
