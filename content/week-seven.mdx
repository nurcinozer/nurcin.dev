## Read

[Herland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531509.Herland)
The story of "Herland" is about the discovery of a society where only women live by three male explorers. This forces the men to rethink their ideas about the roles of women in society. I was excited to start reading the book because of its interesting topic, and I finished it quickly because it was easy to read. However, I have to say that I wasn't satisfied with the plot. I don't want to criticize the author, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, because I know she was a good feminist writer for her time. It's difficult to judge her based on today's modern feminism. Although I was bothered by the book's focus on women only as mothers and how it defended feminist ideas through that. It's also worth mentioning that Charlotte Perkins Gilman had racist views, which is hard to ignore. In Herland, there is no place for men, and there is also no place for different races. That's why it's challenging to read this utopian story while ignoring sexism and nationalism. For these reasons, I was disappointed with this book.

## Started Watching

[The Last Dance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8420184/)
"The Last Dance" is a mini-series with 10 episodes that tells the story of the 1990s Chicago Bulls, led by Michael Jordan. They were one of the best teams in sports history. I'm currently watching the 6th episode and I really like how it shows behind-the-scenes moments from Michael Jordan's career. It's fascinating to see how he and the team faced challenges and how they responded when someone talked negatively about them. The length of the documentary bothered me because it felt a bit prolonged and drawn-out, making it harder to maintain my interest and attention throughout. However, I liked that it goes back and forth in time to show the Bulls' final season, and it also focuses on other team members' journeys. It makes you wonder if they could have won another championship.
